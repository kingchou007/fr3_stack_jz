# Agent guide to fr3-stack

Use this file to orient yourself before changing the repository. It describes
how the system works, where to investigate, and how to verify a change.

## Understand the system first

fr3-stack is a ROS-free Franka Research 3 control stack with two execution sites:

- **Workstation / Python:** a user program generates targets. `Robot` sends
  single-arm commands and receives state; `Arm` adds pose-oriented operations;
  `RobotAgent` adds the policy-loop interface `reset / observe / step`.
- **NUC / C++:** `src/main.cpp` connects to one robot through libfranka, receives
  commands, runs the active controller at 1 kHz, and publishes state at ~200 Hz.
- **Wire:** Cap'n Proto messages in `proto/fr3.capnp`, carried over ZMQ. Commands
  use PUSH/PULL on port 5555; state uses PUB/SUB on port 5556. Command reception
  is latest-wins, not an acknowledged queue of motions.
- **Dual arm:** one coordinator on a workstation talks to two separate NUCs.
  Each daemon still controls one robot. `DualArmCoordinator` operates through
  `ArmEndpoint`; `RobotArmEndpoint` adapts the single-arm client. Coordination
  does not belong inside the low-level controller math.

Trace a command through `Robot.send_*` -> serialization -> `parse_command()` ->
pending command -> controller configuration -> `compute(state, model)` -> torque.
Trace feedback through daemon state publication -> `Robot._sub_loop` -> `State`.

## Choose a reading path for the task

| Task or symptom | Read these files first | Relevant tests |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Connection, missing/stale state, command delivery | `fr3_stack/robot.py`, `state.py`, `tests/conftest.py` | `tests/test_robot_client.py` |
| Pose commands or policy-loop behavior | `fr3_stack/client.py`, `agent.py`, `geometry.py`, `interpolation.py` | `test_arm.py`, `test_agent.py`, `test_geometry.py`, `test_interpolation.py` under `tests/` |
| A gain/profile does not take effect | `fr3_stack/config.py`, `configs/`, `wire/_yaml.py`, `Robot.send_*` | Profile/cache tests in `tests/test_robot_client.py` |
| Add or change a command field | `proto/fr3.capnp`, `fr3_stack/wire/`, `src/main.cpp::parse_command` | `tests/test_schema.py` and matching client tests |
| Torque, impedance, admittance, or hybrid math | `include/fr3_stack/controllers/`, `src/controllers/`, `include/fr3_stack/utils/` | `tests/cpp/test_controller_math.cpp` |
| Dual-arm validation, timing, faults | `fr3_stack/dual_arm.py`, `dual_arm_robot.py`, `docs/dual-arm.md` | `tests/test_dual_arm.py` |
| F/T readings or payload compensation | `include/fr3_stack/sensors/wrench_frame.hpp`, `src/sensors/`, `fr3_stack/sensors/bota/` | Inspect frame/calibration math; hardware behavior needs separate evaluation |
| Build, launch, or dependency failure | `CMakeLists.txt`, `containers/Dockerfile`, `containers/compose.yml`, `fr3-stack` | Configure/build; `bash -n fr3-stack` |
| Website content/navigation | `docs/`, `docs/config/mkdocs.yml`, `.github/workflows/docs.yml` | Strict MkDocs build |

## Follow the existing behavior when making a change

- Write code, comments, documentation, commit messages and PR descriptions in
  English. Keep site-specific paths, addresses and credentials in ignored local
  configuration rather than tracked guides.
- Targets are meters in the arm's base frame. Quaternions on the wire are xyzw;
  Eigen constructors use wxyz. Six-vectors order translation/force before
  rotation/torque. Inspect sensor mount transforms before comparing wrenches.
- `Robot.send_*` uses per-controller sticky caches. A profile replaces its
  controller cache; `send_move_to` gain overrides are per-call. Configuration
  lookup is in `config.py`: check selected files and cache state before tuning.
- Adding a controller parameter usually touches YAML defaults, `_yaml.py`, the
  Python sender, the Cap'n Proto schema, C++ parsing, and controller config/math.
  Follow that complete path and preserve existing schema field ordinals.
- `src/main.cpp` owns controller switching, generators, target interpolation,
  and final torque-rate limiting. A test of `compute()` alone does not cover
  this dispatch logic. Keep networking and other blocking work outside RT.
- Dual-arm snapshots use local monotonic reception time. Paired targets are
  validated before sequential sends; a failure latches FAULT and attempts both
  application-supplied stop callbacks. Inspect `stop_errors`, not just exceptions.
- **Every change gets a `CHANGELOG.md` entry, in the same commit or PR that
  makes it.** Add it under `## [Unreleased]`, in the `Added` / `Changed` /
  `Fixed` / `Removed` / `Deprecated` / `Security` group that fits, following
  [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/). Write what changed
  and *why it matters to someone using the stack* — a reader should be able to
  tell whether the change affects them without opening the diff. Name the files
  or flags involved and link the PR. A behaviour change that a user could hit
  on the robot, however small, is never "too minor to log"; pure formatting,
  typo fixes and comment-only edits are. When a release is cut, the
  `[Unreleased]` block is renamed to the version with its date and a fresh
  empty `[Unreleased]` opened above it, and the two compare links at the bottom
  of the file are updated.
- The current dual-arm implementation has no NUC execution synchronization,
  exclusive ownership lease, local watchdog, shared-frame calibration, or
  collision planner. `docs/dual-arm-coordination-plan.md` is planned work, not
  evidence those features exist. Real-robot evaluation remains pending.

## Practical workflow for an agent

1. Check the current branch and working-tree changes; preserve existing work.
2. Pick the reading path above. Trace the failing behavior from caller to its
   consumer and inspect a nearby test before proposing a fix.
3. Reproduce the problem with a fake daemon or deterministic math fixture where
   possible. Keep the reproducer independent of physical robot motion.
4. Change the smallest responsible layer. When crossing an interface, update
   both sides and test the contract; do not duplicate low-level logic in facades.
5. Run the relevant checks below. State what passed, what could not run, and
   what still needs hardware evaluation. Update the affected `docs/` page.
6. Add a `CHANGELOG.md` entry under `## [Unreleased]`. Every change gets one —
   see the changelog rule under "Follow the existing behavior" above.
7. For workstation/NUC deployment changes, follow [sync.md](sync.md). Update its
   compatibility and rollback notes when changing the schema, daemon, container
   build, or deployment procedure. Record actual client and running-image
   identities; a source checkout or package version alone does not verify the
   deployed NUC binary. Preserve site configuration and persistent data.
8. Update the workstation and NUC release together using `scripts/sync-nuc`.
   Read `.setup/nuc-sync.json` and [sync.md](sync.md) before deployment work.
   Follow the workstation-owned update rules below; the local phase configuration
   determines whether preparation runs locally or through SSH.

## Work PC owns NUC updates

The work PC is the code-maintenance and orchestration site. Its agent performs
the complete update through SSH; the NUC only needs SSH, Git, Docker and the
configured build/diagnostic dependencies. Installing or running Codex or another
agent on the NUC is not required. Do not delegate synchronization or compilation
to an assumed NUC agent, or ask the operator to repeat already-authorized setup.

1. Read the ignored `.setup/nuc-sync.json`, `.setup/site-role.json` when present,
   and the latest successful release receipt. Use the configured SSH target and
   directories; keep credentials and site-specific values out of tracked files.
2. Classify the change. For C++, protocol, SDK, or build/dependency changes, run
   the relevant work-PC tests and prepare a matched release. Model/checkpoint-only
   changes need model tests. Documentation-only changes synchronize the affected
   guides without rebuilding or changing the installed runtime release.
3. In `local_build`, use `build-local` without SSH. When real preparation is
   already authorized and `phase=real_prepare`, run `check` then `build` from
   the work PC; retain the configured variant, including `--jz`. Verify the real
   SSH target, Docker access, kernel, architecture, disk space and control-service
   blockers. An active controller blocks preparation; never stop it automatically.
4. Freeze the selected work-PC source, including reviewed uncommitted changes.
   Select new source files explicitly with `--include`. Upload an independent
   release and build/validate its image over SSH. Do not use a NUC `git pull`,
   package version, or checkout commit as proof of the compiled daemon version.
5. Let `build` install and validate the work-PC SDK from that frozen release.
   When `nuc_sdk_python` is configured, install the NUC diagnostic SDK from the
   same remote release through SSH and check its imports, dependencies and schema.
   This NUC SDK step is agent-orchestrated; `build` does not perform it itself.
   Keep model inference and GPU dependencies on the work PC.
6. Prepare the NUC launch configuration through SSH using the exact image tag,
   release directory and existing external site data. Validate Compose `config`
   and record the previous SDK sources and prepared launch references before
   changing them. Preserve addresses, ports, calibration, recordings and logs.
   Preparation never runs `up`, restarts a daemon, or sends robot commands.
7. Update a NUC development checkout only after comparing it with its last
   installed file manifest. Preserve unexpected NUC edits and bring them back to
   the work PC for review. Never force-pull, reset, or overwrite a dirty checkout
   merely to make synchronization succeed. Immutable release upload remains the
   normal deployment path.
8. Record both actual SDK paths, full source/schema hashes, image ID/labels,
   validation results and rollback references. On a detected failure, restore
   changed SDK/launch references to the previous verified preparation where
   reachable; preserve the previous source and image. If recovery is incomplete,
   record the partial state and blocker instead of claiming paired success.
9. Report image preparation separately from controller activation, firmware
   compatibility and physical-robot validation. Activation requires a separately
   arranged hardware task; a successful build or fake-daemon test does not prove
   the running robot service has been updated.

When several agents work on one task, give each a concrete file/module scope,
input/output contract, and verification command. Agree on shared interface
changes first; integrate the full path once the separate pieces are ready.

## Verification commands and limits

Python development setup and tests:

```bash
python3 -m pip install -e '.[dev]'
python3 -m pytest tests/test_dual_arm.py    # substitute the relevant test module
python3 -m pytest                         # shared API changes: full regression
```

`tests/conftest.py` provides FakeDaemon using real localhost ZMQ and Cap'n Proto.
Tests named `real_tasks` still use this fake. Socket restrictions can prevent
these tests from running; that is different from a controller failure.

C++ controller tests:

```bash
cmake -S . -B /tmp/fr3-tests -DFR3_BUILD_DAEMON=OFF -DFR3_BUILD_TESTS=ON
cmake --build /tmp/fr3-tests --target test_controller_math -j2
ctest --test-dir /tmp/fr3-tests --output-on-failure
```

The current CMake configuration still calls `find_package(Franka REQUIRED)` even
for mock tests. Provide installed dependency prefixes through `CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH`
when necessary; the mock test executable itself uses `tests/cpp/franka_mock/`.
The full daemon additionally needs cppzmq, Cap'n Proto, yaml-cpp, and the Bota
library; use `containers/Dockerfile` to identify the intended dependency versions.

Documentation:

```bash
python3 -m pip install -r docs/requirements.txt
python3 -m mkdocs build --strict -f docs/config/mkdocs.yml
```

`docs/` is the GitHub Pages source; `site/` is generated output. Do not create a
second copy of website content. Consult `docs/development.md` for deployment.
`examples/`, daemon launch commands, and calibration tools can operate hardware;
use them only as part of an explicitly requested hardware task, not unit tests.
